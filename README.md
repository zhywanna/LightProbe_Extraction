# LightProbe_Extraction

# COMING SOON

Extracting spherical harmonic coefficients of points in the space around objects in NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) scenes constructed using the PyTorch deep learning framework, to create Light Probes for use in Unity. These Light Probes are used to render virtual characters in Unity with the real-world environment modeled using NeRF.
